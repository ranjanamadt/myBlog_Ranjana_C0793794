                    Lohri (Devanagari: लोह्ड़ी, Gurmukhi: ਲੋਹੜੀ, Shahmukhi: لوہڑی) is a popular winter folk festival
                    celebrated primarily in the Indian Subcontinent. The significance and legends about the
                    Lohri festival are many and these link the festival to the Punjab region. It is believed by many
                    that the festival marks the passing of the winter solstice. Lohri marks the end of winter, and is a
                    traditional welcome of longer days

                    Vaisakhi (IAST: vaisākhī), also pronounced Baisakhi, marks the first day of the month of Vaisakha
                    and is usually celebrated annually on 13 or 14 April as the solar new year.
                    Vaisakhi observes major events in the history of Sikhism and the Indian subcontinent that happened
                    in the Punjab region. Vaisakhi as a major Sikh festival marks the birth of the Khalsa order by Guru
                    Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru of Sikhism, on Vaisakhi of 1699.
