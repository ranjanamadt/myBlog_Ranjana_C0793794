                    <h2> Common Festivals in India</h2>
                    <h4> Maha Sivarathri </h4>
                   
                    <p > Maha Shivaratri is an annual festival dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, and is particularly
                        important in the Shaivism tradition of Hinduism. Unlike most Hindu festivals which are
                        celebrated
                        during the day, the Maha Shivaratri is celebrated at night. Furthermore, unlike most Hindu
                        festivals
                        which include expression of cultural revelry, the Maha Shivaratri is a solemn event notable for
                        its
                        introspective focus, fasting, meditation on Shiva, self study, social harmony and an all night
                        vigil
                        at Shiva temples.

                        that celebrates the birth of Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu. Hindus celebrate Janmashtami
                        by
                        fasting, singing, praying together, preparing and sharing special food, night vigils, and
                        visiting
                        Krishna or Vishnu temples. Major Krishna temples organize recitation of ‘'Bhagavata Purana and
                        Bhagavad Gita.

                        Hinduism.The festival celebrates the descent of Vishnu as the Rama avatar, through his
                        birth to King Dasharatha and Queen Kausalya in Ayodhya.The festival is a part of the spring
                        (Vasanta) Navratri, and falls on the ninth day of the bright half (Shukla Paksha) of Chaitra,
                        the first month in the Hindu calendar.

                        the "Festival of Colours" and the "Festival of Spring".The festival celebrates the
                        eternal and divine love of Radha Krishna.It also signifies the triumph of good over the
                        evil, as it celebrates the victory of Lord Vishnu as Narasimha Narayana over
                        Hiranyakashipu. Holi is an ancient Indian religious festival that has also become popular
                        outside of India.

                        protecting them, receiving a gift in return, and traditionally investing the brothers with a
                        share of the responsibility of their potential care.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Deepavali </h4>
                    <p> One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, Diwali symbolizes the spiritual "victory of light
                        over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance". Furthermore, it is, in some
                        regions, a celebration of the day Lord Rama returned to his kingdom Ayodhya with his wife Sita
                        and his brother Lakshmana after defeating Ravana in Lanka and serving 14 years of exile. In the
                        lead-up to Diwali, celebrants will prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes
                        and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis (colorful art circle patterns).During
                        Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes
                        with diyas and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and
                        wealth, light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts
                        are shared. Diwali is also a major cultural event for the Hindu, Sikh and Jain diaspora.
                    </p>

                    <h4> Christmas Day </h4>
                    <p> Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed on December
                        25
                        as a religious and cultural celebration. The major cities of India like the cosmopolitan city of
                        Mumbai, Goa, Delhi, to name a few are abodes to thousands of Roman Catholics. Therefore midnight
                        mass is considered to be an integral part of the grand Christmas celebration in India. All the
                        family members get together and walk to be part of the mass.
                        After this, a huge Christmas feast of delicious delicacies is devoured by the participants of
                        the
                        mass. The midnight mass comes to an end once the neatly-wrapped gifts are exchanged. For this
                        day
                        churches are extravagantly decorated with Christmas adornments like Poinsettia flowers, aromatic
                        candles, and glittering lights.
                        India gets transformed into an absolute Christmas wonderland with twinkling lightning,
                        traditional
                        tree décor, and Christmas songs playing non-stop.</p>

                    <h4> Eid al-Adha</h4>
                    <p> Eid al-Adha (Arabic: عید الأضحى‎, romanized: ʿĪd al-ʾAḍḥā, lit. 'Festival of the Sacrifice') is
                        the
                        latter of the two official holidays celebrated within Islam (the other being Eid al-Fitr). It
                        honors
                        the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to
                        God's
                        command. Before Abraham could sacrifice his son, however, God provided a lamb to sacrifice
                        instead.
                        In commemoration of this intervention, animals are sacrificed ritually. One third of their meat
                        is
                        consumed by the family offering the sacrifice, while the rest is distributed to the poor and
                        needy.
                        Sweets and gifts are given, and extended family are typically visited and welcomed.[6] The day
                        is
                        also sometimes called Big Eid or the Greater Eid.
                        Prophet Muhammad's Birthday (Id-e-Milad)
                        Eid Milad un Nabiis the observance of the birthday of the Islamic prophet Muhammad[6] which is
                        commemorated in Rabi' al-awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar<br>
                        Here is a list of different types of Eid celebrated in a year.
