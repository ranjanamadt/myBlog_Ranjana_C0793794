                <h3> Common Festivals in India</h3>
                <h4> Maha Sivarathri </h4>
                <p> Maha Shivaratri is an annual festival dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, and is particularly
                    important in the Shaivism tradition of Hinduism. Unlike most Hindu festivals which are celebrated
                    during the day, the Maha Shivaratri is celebrated at night. Furthermore, unlike most Hindu festivals
                    which include expression of cultural revelry, the Maha Shivaratri is a solemn event notable for its
                    introspective focus, fasting, meditation on Shiva, self study, social harmony and an all night vigil
                    at Shiva temples
                <h4> Krishna Janmashtami</h4>
                <p> Krishna Janmashtami, also known simply as Janmashtami or Gokulashtami, is an annual Hindu festival
                    that celebrates the birth of Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu. Hindus celebrate Janmashtami by
                    fasting, singing, praying together, preparing and sharing special food, night vigils, and visiting
                    Krishna or Vishnu temples. Major Krishna temples organize recitation of ‘'Bhagavata Purana and
                    Bhagavad Gita
                </p>
                <h4> Rama Navami</h4>
                <p> Rama Navami is a Hindu spring festival that celebrates the birthday of Rama, the seventh avatar
                    of the god Vishnu. Rama is particularly important in the Vaishnavite tradition of
                    Hinduism.[3][4] The festival celebrates the descent of Vishnu as the Rama avatar, through his
                    birth to King Dasharatha and Queen Kausalya in Ayodhya.[5] The festival is a part of the spring
                    (Vasanta) Navratri, and falls on the ninth day of the bright half (Shukla Paksha) of Chaitra,
                    the first month in the Hindu calendar.
                </p>
                <h4> Holi </h4>
                <p> Holi ( /ˈhoʊliː/) is a popular ancient Indian festival, also known as the "Festival of Love",
                    the "Festival of Colours" and the "Festival of Spring".[1][8][9] The festival celebrates the
                    eternal and divine love of Radha Krishna.[10][11] It also signifies the triumph of good over the
                    evil,[12][13] as it celebrates the victory of Lord Vishnu as Narasimha Narayana over
                    Hiranyakashipu. Holi is an ancient Indian religious festival that has also become popular
                    outside of India
                </p>
                <h4> Raksha Bandhan </h4>
                <p> Raksha Bandhan, also Rakshabandhan,[4] is a popular, traditionally Hindu, annual rite, or
                    ceremony, which is central to a festival of the same name, celebrated in South Asia, and among
                    people around the world influenced by Hindu culture. On this day, sisters of all ages tie a
                    talisman, or amulet, called the rakhi, around the wrists of their brothers, symbolically
                    protecting them, receiving a gift in return, and traditionally investing the brothers with a
                    share of the responsibility of their potential care.
                </p>
                <h4> Dussehra </h4>
                <p> Vijayadashami (IAST: Vijayadaśamī) also known as Dussehra, Dasara or Dashain, is a major Hindu
                    festival celebrated at the end of Navaratri every year. it marks the end of Ramlila and
                    remembers god Rama's victory over the Ravan.
                </p>
                <h4>Deepavali </h4>
                <p> One of the most popular festivals of Hinduism, Diwali symbolizes the spiritual "victory of light
                    over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance". Furthermore, it is, in some
                    regions, a celebration of the day Lord Rama returned to his kingdom Ayodhya with his wife Sita
                    and his brother Lakshmana after defeating Ravana in Lanka and serving 14 years of exile. In the
                    lead-up to Diwali, celebrants will prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes
                    and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis (colorful art circle patterns).[15] During
                    Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes
                    with diyas and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and
                    wealth,[note 1] light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts
                    are shared. Diwali is also a major cultural event for the Hindu, Sikh and Jain diaspora
                </p>

                <h4> Christmas Day </h4>
                <p> Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed on December 25[a]
                    as a religious and cultural celebration. The major cities of India like the cosmopolitan city of
                    Mumbai, Goa, Delhi, to name a few are abodes to thousands of Roman Catholics. Therefore midnight
                    mass is considered to be an integral part of the grand Christmas celebration in India. All the
                    family members get together and walk to be part of the mass.
                    After this, a huge Christmas feast of delicious delicacies is devoured by the participants of the
                    mass. The midnight mass comes to an end once the neatly-wrapped gifts are exchanged. For this day
                    churches are extravagantly decorated with Christmas adornments like Poinsettia flowers, aromatic
                    candles, and glittering lights.
                    India gets transformed into an absolute Christmas wonderland with twinkling lightning, traditional
                    tree décor, and Christmas songs playing non-stop.</p>

                <h4> Eid al-Adha</h4>
                <p> Eid al-Adha (Arabic: عید الأضحى‎, romanized: ʿĪd al-ʾAḍḥā, lit. 'Festival of the Sacrifice') is the
                    latter of the two official holidays celebrated within Islam (the other being Eid al-Fitr). It
                    honors
                    the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son Ishmael as an act of obedience to God's
                    command. Before Abraham could sacrifice his son, however, God provided a lamb to sacrifice instead.
                    In commemoration of this intervention, animals are sacrificed ritually. One third of their meat is
                    consumed by the family offering the sacrifice, while the rest is distributed to the poor and needy.
                    Sweets and gifts are given, and extended family are typically visited and welcomed.[6] The day is
                    also sometimes called Big Eid or the Greater Eid.[7]
                    Prophet Muhammad's Birthday (Id-e-Milad)
                    Eid Milad un Nabiis the observance of the birthday of the Islamic prophet Muhammad[6] which is
                    commemorated in Rabi' al-awwal, the third month in the Islamic calendar</p>
