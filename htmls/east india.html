                            observed in January.The Rongali Bihu is the most important of the three, celebrating
                            spring festival. The Bhogali Bihu or the Magh Bihu is a harvest festival, with community
                            feasts. The Kongali Bihu or the Kati Bihu is the sombre, thrifty one reflecting a season of

                            Durga Puja, also known as Durgotsava, or Sharodotsava
                            , is an annual Hindu festival originating in the Indian
                            subcontinent which reveres and pays homage to the Hindu goddess, Durga. As per Hindu
                            scriptures, the festival marks the victory of goddess Durga in her battle against the
                            shape-shifting asura, Mahishasura. Thus, the festival epitomises the victory of
                            good over evil, though it is also in part a harvest festival celebrating the goddess as the
                            motherly power behind all of life and creation. Durga puja coincides with Navaratri
                            and Dussehra celebrations observed by other traditions of Hinduism

                            Ratha-jatra is derived from two Sanskrit words, Ratha (रथ) which means chariot or carriage,
                            and jātrā (ଯାତ୍ରା) which means journey or pilgrimage. Rathajatra is a journey in a chariot
                            accompanied by the public. It typically refers to a procession (journey) of deities, people
                            dressed like deities, or simply religious saints and political leaders. The term appears
                            in medieval texts of India such as the Puranas, which mention the Rathajatra of Surya (Sun
                            god), of Devi (Mother goddess), and of Vishnu. During the Jagannath Rath jatra, the triads
                            are usually worshiped in the sanctum of the temple at Puri,
