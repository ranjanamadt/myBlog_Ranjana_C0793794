                    Durga Puja 
                </h4>

                <p>
                    Durga Puja (pronounced [dʊrɡa puːdʒa]), also known as Durgotsava, or Sharodotsava (pronounced [dʊrɡoːtsəʋə]), is an annual Hindu festival originating in the Indian subcontinent which reveres and pays homage to the Hindu goddess, Durga. As per Hindu scriptures, the festival marks the victory of goddess Durga in her battle against the shape-shifting asura, Mahishasura.[13][14][A] Thus, the festival epitomises the victory of good over evil, though it is also in part a harvest festival celebrating the goddess as the motherly power behind all of life and creation.[16][17] Durga puja coincides with Navaratri and Dussehra celebrations observed by other traditions of Hinduism

                    Rath Jatra
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Ratha-jatra is derived from two Sanskrit words, Ratha (रथ) which means chariot or carriage, and jātrā (ଯାତ୍ରା) which means journey or pilgrimage. Rathajatra is a journey in a chariot accompanied by the public. It typically refers to a procession (journey) of deities, people dressed like deities, or simply religious saints and political leaders.[5] The term appears in medieval texts of India such as the Puranas, which mention the Rathajatra of Surya (Sun god), of Devi (Mother goddess), and of Vishnu. During the Jagannath Rath jatra, the triads are usually worshiped in the sanctum of the temple at Puri,
